Algorithm: COSMIC Measurement Process
Input: Arduino code
Outputs: Total CFP value

{
 1. Read the Arduino code as input.
 2. Initialize counters for each type of data movement:
    - count_E = 0
    - count_X = 0
    - count_R = 0
    - count_W = 0
 3. Identify all functional processes

 4. For Each functional process:
    a. If the line contains a triggering entry:
        - Increment count_E by 1.
    b. If the line contains the value the declared function returns:
        - Increment count_X by 1.    
    c. If the line contains input parameters of function    
            For each input parameter: 
                - Increment count_E by 1.
    
 5. For each body of the function:
            For each line of the Arduino code, check for the following guidelines:
                a. If the line contains a signal received via the network:
                    - Increment count_E by 1.
                b. If the line contains a value returned after calling a function from an external library:
                    - Increment count_E by 1.
                c. If the line contains a signal sent via the network:
                    - Increment count_X by 1.
                d. If the line contains data retrieved from persistent storage:
                    - Increment count_R by 1.
                e. If the line contains a variable read:
                    - Increment count_R by 1.
                f. If the line contains retrieving a hardware configuration:
                    - Increment count_R by 1.
                g. If the line contains data stored in persistent storage:
                    - Increment count_W by 1.
                h. If the line contains a variable write:
                    - Increment count_W by 1.
                i. If the line contains initialization of a variable:
                    - Increment count_W by 1.
                j. If the line contains a hardware configuration:
                    - Increment count_W by 1.

 6. Output the total count of each type of data movement within functional processes:
        - Size (FP) = Σ (count_E) + Σ (count_X) + Σ (count_R) + Σ (count_W) 
    }
